This plugin adds a net fishing mechanic, controls loot distributions through config by biomes into 3 groups meant to distinguish between freshwater and saltwater biomes, and creates fish with a length attribute viewable through a crafting recipe.

This plugin is not currently meant for public use. It lacks an API, may contain unresolved bugs, does not contain all intended features still in development, and is specifically meant for the Alathra Minecraft server. You are welcome to use it at your own discretion/peril.
